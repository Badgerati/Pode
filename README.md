> üíù A lot of my free time, evenings, and weekends goes into making Pode happen; please do consider sponsoring as it will really help! üòä

Pode is a Cross-Platform framework for creating web servers to host [REST APIs](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Tutorials/Routes/Overview/), [Web Pages](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Tutorials/Routes/Examples/WebPages/), and [SMTP/TCP](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Servers/) Servers. Pode also allows you to render dynamic files using [`.pode`](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Tutorials/Views/Pode/) files, which are just embedded PowerShell, or other [Third-Party](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Tutorials/Views/ThirdParty/) template engines. Plus many more features, including [Azure Functions](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Hosting/AzureFunctions/) and [AWS Lambda](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Hosting/AwsLambda/) support!

See [here](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Getting-Started/FirstApp) for building your first app! Don't know HTML, CSS, or JavaScript? No problem! [Pode.Web](https://github.com/Badgerati/Pode.Web) is currently a work in progress, and lets you build web pages using purely PowerShell!

## üôå Contributing

> The full contributing guide can be [found here](https://github.com/Badgerati/Pode/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Pull Requests, Bug Reports and Feature Requests are welcome! Feel free to help out with Issues and Projects!

To run the unit tests, run the following command from the root of the repository (this will build Pode and, if needed, auto-install Pester/.NET):

```powershell
Invoke-Build Test
```

To just build Pode, before running any examples, run the following:

```powershell
Invoke-Build Build
```

To work on issues you can fork Pode, and then open a Pull Request for approval. Pull Requests should be made against the `develop` branch. Each Pull Request should also have an appropriate issue created.
