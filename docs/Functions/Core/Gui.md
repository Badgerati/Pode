# Gui

!!! warning
    Currently only supported on Windows due to using WPF.

## Description

The `gui` function allows you to run a server and have it automatically open as a desktop application. In reality it's just a WPF application with a WebBrowser control, and the server running in the background.

If you run your server directly, then the terminal will remain visible. However, you could have a script which opens PowerShell as hidden and launches the server.

!!! tip
    You can use the `gui` and listen on any endpoint, however it's recommended to `listen` on localhost - that way you don't need to run the application with elevated permissions.

## Examples

### Example 1

The following example will launch the server, and open an application called "Pode Example 1". It will also set the icon of the application:

```powershell
server {
    listen localhost:8080 http

    gui 'Pode Example 1' @{
        Icon = '../images/icon.png'
    }
}
```

### Example 2

The following example will launch the server, but will open the application as fullscreen:

```powershell
server {
    listen localhost:8080 http

    gui 'Pode Example 2' @{
        State = 'Maximized'
    }
}
```

### Example 3

The following example will launch the server, and the application's window will open at a defined fixed size:

```powershell
server {
    listen localhost:8080 http

    gui 'Pode Example 2' @{
        ResizeMode = 'NoResize'
        Width = 1200
        Height = 700
    }
}
```
