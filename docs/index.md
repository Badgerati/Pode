> 💝 A lot of my free time, evenings, and weekends goes into making Pode happen; please do consider sponsoring as it will really help! 😊

Pode is a Cross-Platform framework to create web servers that host REST APIs, Web Sites, and TCP/SMTP Servers. It also allows you to render dynamic files using `.pode` files, which is effectively embedded PowerShell, or other Third-Party template engines. Pode also has support for middleware, sessions, authentication, and logging; as well as access and rate limiting features. There's also Azure Functions and AWS Lambda support!

## 🔥 Quick Look!

Below is a quick example of using Pode to create a single REST API endpoint to return a JSON response. It will listen on an endpoint, create the route, and respond with a JSON object when `http://localhost:8080/ping` is called:

```powershell
Start-PodeServer {
    Add-PodeEndpoint -Address localhost -Port 8080 -Protocol Http

    Add-PodeRoute -Method Get -Path '/ping' -ScriptBlock {
        Write-PodeJsonResponse -Value @{ 'value' = 'pong' }
    }
}
```
