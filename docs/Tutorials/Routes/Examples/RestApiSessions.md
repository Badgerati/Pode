# REST APIs and Sessions

[Sessions](../../../Middleware/Types/Sessions) in Pode are normally done using cookies, but you can also use them via headers as well. This way you can have two endpoints for authentication login/logout, and the rest of your routes depend on a valid SessionId.

!!! info
    The full example can be seen on GitHub in `examples/web-auth-basic-header.ps1`.

## Server

To start off, you'll need the main [`Start-PodeServer`](../../../../Functions/Core/Start-PodeServer) function; here we'll use 2 threads to handle requests:

```powershell
Start-PodeServer -Thread 2 {
    # the rest of the logic goes here!
}
```

Next, we'll need an endpoint to listen on. Using the [`Add-PodeEndpoint`](../../../../Functions/Core/Add-PodeEndpoint) function will let you specify and endpoint for your server to listen on, such as `http://localhost:8080`:

```powershell
Add-PodeEndpoint -Address * -Port 8080 -Protocol Http
```

## Enabling Sessions

To use sessions with headers for our authentication, we need to setup Session Middleware using the [`Enable-PodeSessionMiddleware`](../../../../Functions/Sessions/Enable-PodeSessionMiddleware/) function. Here our sessions will last for 2 minutes, and will be extended on each request:

```powershell
Enable-PodeSessionMiddleware -Duration 120 -Extend -UseHeaders
```

## Authentication

Once we have the Sessions enabled, we need to setup Basic authentication - the username/password here are hard-coded, but normally you would validate against some database:

```powershell
New-PodeAuthScheme -Basic | Add-PodeAuth -Name 'Login' -ScriptBlock {
    param($username, $password)

    # here you'd check a real user storage, this is just for example
    if ($username -eq 'morty' -and $password -eq 'pickle') {
        return @{
            User = @{
                ID ='M0R7Y302'
                Name = 'Morty'
                Type = 'Human'
            }
        }
    }

    # aww geez! no user was found
    return @{ Message = 'Invalid details supplied' }
}
```

## Login and Logout

The first two routes will be two POST routes to login/logout a user. This first route will authenticate the user, and then respond back with a session in the response's `pode.sid` header:

```powershell
Add-PodeRoute -Method Post -Path '/login' -Authentication 'Login'
```

For the login endpoint, you would the request and supply the normal `Authorization` header.

The second route will require the session to be sent in the request's `pode.sid` header, and will expire and destroy the session:

```powershell
Add-PodeRoute -Method Post -Path '/logout' -Authentication 'Login' -Logout
```

The first route on success will return with a 200 response, the logout route will respond with a 401 since the session no longer exists. And other routes called using the same session will also return with a 401.

## Routes

This is a very basic POST route, but it will return a list of users if a valid `pode.sid` header has been supplied on the request:

```powershell
Add-PodeRoute -Method Post -Path '/users' -Authentication 'Login' -ScriptBlock {
    Write-PodeJsonResponse -Value @{
        Users = @(
            @{
                Name = 'Deep Thought'
                Age = 42
            },
            @{
                Name = 'Leeroy Jenkins'
                Age = 1337
            }
        )
    }
}
```

If you don't supply a session, or supply an invalid one, then a 401 in returned. You could also just straight-up supply the `Authorization` header on the request instead.

## Web Requests

If you use the exact endpoint and dummy credentials above, then the follow are calls you can do on the PowerShell CLI.

### Login

This call will authenticate and create a session:

```powershell
$session = (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:8080/login -Method Post -Headers @{ Authorization = 'Basic bW9ydHk6cGlja2xl' }).Headers['pode.sid'][0]
```

### Users

This call will use the above session from logging in, and return a list of users:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:8080/users -Method Post -Headers @{ 'pode.sid' = "$session" }
```

### Logout

This call will use the same session, but will time it out:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:8085/logout -Method Post -Headers @{ 'pode.sid' = "$session" }
```
