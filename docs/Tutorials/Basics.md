# Basics

 <sub><b>!!! Warning</b>
You can initiate only one server per PowerShell instance. To run multiple servers, start additional PowerShell, or pwsh, sessions. Each session can run its own server. This is fundamental to how Pode operates, so consider it when designing your scripts and infrastructure.</sub>


While it’s not mandatory, we strongly recommend importing the Pode module with a specified maximum version. This practice helps to prevent potential issues arising from breaking changes introduced in new major versions:

```powershell
Import-Module -Name Pode -MaximumVersion 2.99.99
```

To further enhance the robustness of your code, consider wrapping the import statement within a try/catch block. This way, if the module fails to load, your script won’t proceed, preventing possible errors or unexpected behavior:

```powershell
try {
    Import-Module -Name Pode -MaximumVersion 2.99.99
} catch {
    Write-Error "Failed to load the Pode module"
    throw
}
```

The script for your server should be set in the [`Start-PodeServer`](../../Functions/Core/Start-PodeServer) function, via the `-ScriptBlock` parameter. The following example will listen over HTTP on port 8080, and expose a simple HTML page of running processes at `http://localhost:8080/processes`:

```powershell
Start-PodeServer {
    # attach to port 8080 for http
    Add-PodeEndpoint -Address * -Port 8080 -Protocol Http

    # a simple page for displaying services
    Add-PodePage -Name 'processes' -ScriptBlock { Get-Process }
}
```

To start the server you can either:

* Directly run the `./server.ps1` script, or
* If you've created a `package.json` file, ensure the `./server.ps1` script is set as your `main` or `scripts/start`, then just run `pode start` (more [here](../../Getting-Started/CLI))

## Terminating

Once your Pode server has started, you can terminate it at any time using `Ctrl+C`. If you want to disable your server from being terminated then use the `-DisableTermination` switch on the [`Start-PodeServer`](../../Functions/Core/Start-PodeServer) function.

## Restarting

You can restart your Pode server by using `Ctrl+R`, or on Unix you can also use `Shift+C` and `Shift+R` as well. When the server restarts it will only re-invoke the initial `-ScriptBlock`, so any changes made to this main scriptblock will *not* be reflected - you'll need to terminate and start your server again.

## Script from File

You can also define your server's scriptblock in a separate file, and use it via the `-FilePath` parameter on the [`Start-PodeServer`](../../Functions/Core/Start-PodeServer) function.

Using this approach there are 2 ways to start you server:

1. You can put your scriptblock into a separate file, and put your [`Start-PodeServer`](../../Functions/Core/Start-PodeServer) call into another script. This other script is then what you call on the CLI.
2. You can directly call [`Start-PodeServer`](../../Functions/Core/Start-PodeServer) on the CLI.

When you call [`Start-PodeServer`](../../Functions/Core/Start-PodeServer) directly on the CLI, then your server's root path will be set to directory of that file. You can override this behaviour by either defining a path via `-RootPath`, or by telling the server to use the current working path as root via `-CurrentPath`.

For example, the following is a file that contains the same scriptblock for the server at the top of this page. Following that are the two ways to run the server - the first is via another script, and the second is directly from the CLI:

* File.ps1

```powershell
{
    # attach to port 8080 for http
    Add-PodeEndpoint -Address * -Port 8080 -Protocol Http

    # a simple page for displaying services
    Add-PodePage -Name 'processes' -ScriptBlock { Get-Process }
}
```

* Server.ps1 (start via script)

```powershell
Start-PodeServer -FilePath './File.ps1'
```

then use `./Server.ps1` on the CLI.

* CLI (start from CLI)

```powershell
PS> Start-PodeServer -FilePath './File.ps1'
```

!!! tip
    Normally when you restart your Pode server any changes to the main scriptblock don't reflect. However, if you reference a file instead, then restarting the server will reload the scriptblock from that file - so any changes will reflect.

## Internationalization

Pode has built-in support for internationalization (i18n). By default, Pode uses the `$PsUICulture` variable to determine the User Interface Culture (UICulture).

You can enforce a specific localization when importing the Pode module by using the UICulture argument. This argument accepts a culture code, which specifies the language and regional settings to use.

Here’s an example of how to enforce Korean localization:

```powershell
Import-Module -Name Pode -ArgumentList 'ko-KR'
```

In this example, 'ko-KR' is the culture code for Korean as used in South Korea. You can replace 'ko-KR' with the culture code for any other language or region.

As an alternative to specifying the UICulture when importing the Pode module, you can also change the UICulture within the PowerShell environment itself.

This can be done using the following command:

```powershell
[System.Threading.Thread]::CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = 'ko-KR'
```

This command changes the UICulture for the current PowerShell session to Korean as used in South Korea.

Please note that this change is temporary and will only affect the current session. If you open a new PowerShell session, it will use the default UICulture.
