# SSL Protocols

By default, the server chooses the allowed SSL/TLS protocols based on the operating systemâ€™s native support.

For example, on Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 only TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are enabled, while older systems (such as Windows Vista/Server 2008) allow SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0. This behavior follows the table below:

| Operating System                   | SSL 2.0             | SSL 3.0             | TLS 1.0             | TLS 1.1             | TLS 1.2            | TLS 1.3            |
|------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Windows Vista / Server 2008        | Enabled             | Enabled             | Not Supported       | Not Supported       | Not Supported      | Not Supported      |
| Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2         | Enabled             | Enabled             | Disabled            | Disabled            | Disabled           | Not Supported      |
| Windows 8 / Server 2012            | Disabled by Default | Enabled by Default  | Enabled by Default  | Enabled by Default  | Enabled by Default | Not Supported      |
| Windows 10 (Build 20170 and later) | No                  | Disabled by Default | Enabled by Default  | Enabled by Default  | Enabled by Default | Enabled by Default |
| Windows 11 / Server 2022           | No                  | Disabled by Default | Disabled by Default | Disabled by Default | Enabled by Default | Enabled by Default |
| macOS 10.8 - 10.10                 | No                  | Yes                 | Yes                 | Yes                 | Yes                | No                 |
| macOS 10.11                        | No                  | No                  | Yes                 | Yes                 | Yes                | No                 |
| macOS 10.13 and later              | No                  | No                  | Yes                 | Yes                 | Yes                | Yes                |
| Linux (OpenSSL 1.0.1 - 1.0.1f)     | No                  | Yes                 | Yes                 | Yes                 | Yes                | No                 |
| Linux (OpenSSL 1.0.1g and later)   | No                  | No                  | Yes                 | Yes                 | Yes                | No                 |
| Linux (OpenSSL 1.1.1 and later)    | No                  | No                  | Yes                 | Yes                 | Yes                | Yes                |

**Notes:**

- **Windows Operating Systems:**
  - TLS 1.3 is supported starting from Windows 10 Build 20170 and Windows Server 2022.
  - Earlier versions (like Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2) support up to TLS 1.2, but may require manual configuration to enable it.

- **macOS:**
  - TLS 1.3 support begins with macOS 10.13.

- **Linux:**
  - The supported SSL/TLS protocols on Linux systems depend on the version of OpenSSL installed:
    - OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 to 1.0.1f support up to TLS 1.2, with SSL 3.0 enabled by default.
    - OpenSSL version 1.0.1g and later disable SSL 3.0 by default.
    - OpenSSL version 1.1.1 and later add support for TLS 1.3.

## Override the Default Values

If you wish to override the defaults, you can customize the allowed protocols in your `server.psd1` configuration file. For example, if you want to allow only TLS protocols (excluding the deprecated SSL versions), you can configure it as follows:

```powershell
@{
    Server = @{
        Ssl = @{
            Protocols = @('Tls', 'Tls11', 'Tls12')
        }
    }
}
```

Or, to include TLS 1.3 where supported:

```powershell
@{
    Server = @{
        Ssl = @{
            Protocols = @('Tls', 'Tls11', 'Tls12', 'Tls13')
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration allows you to explicitly set the protocols from the following list of supported values: `'Ssl2'`, `'Ssl3'`, `'Tls'`, `'Tls11'`, `'Tls12'`, and `'Tls13'`.

> **Important:** Overriding these default values in your configuration file does **not** automatically enable the corresponding protocols at the operating system level. The OS may block a protocol unless its native settings are also changed. In other words, even if you add `'Ssl3'` to your allowed protocols, Windows 11 will still reject SSLv3 connections unless you modify the OS settings.

### Example: Enabling SSLv3 on Windows 11

By default, Windows 11 disables SSLv3 in its Schannel settings. To enable SSLv3, you need to change the registry settings. **Proceed with caution** as enabling SSLv3 can expose your system to known vulnerabilities (such as the POODLE attack).

You can enable SSLv3 on Windows 11 using PowerShell as follows:

```powershell
# Create the registry keys for SSL 3.0 if they don't already exist
New-Item -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\SSL 3.0" -Force | Out-Null
New-Item -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\SSL 3.0\Client" -Force | Out-Null
New-Item -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\SSL 3.0\Server" -Force | Out-Null

# Enable SSLv3 for both client and server by setting the Enabled DWORD to 1
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\SSL 3.0\Client" -Name "Enabled" -Value 1 -Type DWord
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\SSL 3.0\Server" -Name "Enabled" -Value 1 -Type DWord

Write-Output "SSLv3 has been enabled. A system restart may be required for the changes to take effect."
```

After making these changes, your Windows 11 system will accept SSLv3 connections. Remember that this registry modification is an OS-level change, and overriding the configuration in `server.psd1` alone will not suffice.
