# Certificates

Pode has the ability to generate and bind self-signed certificates (for dev/testing), as well as the ability to bind existing certificates for HTTPS or JWT.

## Setting Up HTTPS in Pode

Pode provides multiple ways to configure HTTPS on [`Add-PodeEndpoint`](../../Functions/Core/Add-PodeEndpoint):

- **File-based certificates:**
  - `-Certificate`: Path to a `.cer` or `.pem` file.
  - `-Certificate` with `-CertificatePassword`: Path to a `.pfx` file and its password.
  - `-Certificate` with `-CertificateKey`: Paths to a certificate/key PEM file pair.
  - `-Certificate`, `-CertificateKey`, and `-CertificatePassword`: Paths to an encrypted PEM file pair and its password.

- **Windows Certificate Store:**
  - `-CertificateThumbprint`: Uses a certificate installed at `Cert:\CurrentUser\My`.
  - `-CertificateName`: Uses a certificate installed at `Cert:\CurrentUser\My` by name.

- **X.509 Certificates:**
  - `-X509Certificate`: Provides a certificate object of type `X509Certificate2`.
  - `-SelfSigned`: Generates a quick self-signed `X509Certificate` for development.

- **Custom Certificate Management:**
  - Pode’s built-in functions allow better control over certificate creation, import, and export.

## Generating a Self-Signed Certificate

Pode provides the **`New-PodeSelfSignedCertificate`** function for creating self-signed X.509 certificates for development and testing purposes.

### Features of `New-PodeSelfSignedCertificate`

- ✅ Creates a **self-signed certificate** for HTTPS, JWT, or other use cases.
- ✅ Supports **RSA** and **ECDSA** keys with configurable key sizes.
- ✅ Can include **multiple Subject Alternative Names (SANs)** (e.g., `localhost`, IP addresses).
- ✅ Allows setting **certificate purposes (ServerAuth, ClientAuth, etc.).**
- ✅ Provides **ephemeral certificates** (in-memory only, not stored on disk).
- ✅ Supports **exportable certificates** that can be saved for later use.

### Usage Examples

#### 1️⃣ Generate a Self-Signed Certificate for HTTPS

```powershell
$cert = New-PodeSelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "example.com" -CertificatePurpose ServerAuth
```

- Creates a **self-signed RSA certificate** for `example.com`.
- The certificate is valid for HTTPS (`ServerAuth`).

#### 2️⃣ Generate a Self-Signed Certificate for Local Development

```powershell
$cert = New-PodeSelfSignedCertificate -Loopback
```

- Automatically includes common loopback addresses:
  - `127.0.0.1`
  - `::1`
  - `localhost`
  - The machine’s hostname

#### 3️⃣ Generate an ECDSA Certificate

```powershell
$cert = New-PodeSelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "test.local" -KeyType "ECDSA" -KeyLength 384
```

- Creates a **self-signed ECDSA certificate** with a **384-bit** key.

#### 4️⃣ Generate a Certificate That Exists Only in Memory (Ephemeral)

```powershell
$cert = New-PodeSelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "temp.local" -Ephemeral
```

- The private key is **not stored on disk**, and the certificate only exists **in-memory**.

#### 5️⃣ Generate an Exportable Certificate

```powershell
$cert = New-PodeSelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "secureapp.local" -Exportable
```

- The certificate is **exportable** and can be saved as a `.pfx` or `.pem` file later.

#### 6️⃣ Bind a Self-Signed Certificate to an HTTPS Endpoint

```powershell
Start-PodeServer {
    $cert = New-PodeSelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "example.com" -CertificatePurpose ServerAuth
    Add-PodeEndpoint -Address * -Port 8443 -Protocol Https -X509Certificate $cert
}
```

- Creates an HTTPS endpoint using a self-signed certificate.

## Generating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

To generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) along with a private key, use the **`New-PodeCertificateRequest`** function:

```powershell
$csr = New-PodeCertificateRequest -DnsName "example.com" -CommonName "example.com" -KeyType "RSA" -KeyLength 2048
```

This will create a CSR file and a private key file in the current directory. You can specify additional parameters such as organization details and certificate purposes.

### Using a CSR to Obtain a Certificate

Once you have generated a CSR, you need to submit it to a **Certificate Authority (CA)** (such as Let's Encrypt, DigiCert, or a private CA) to receive a signed certificate. The process typically involves:

1. Uploading or providing the `.csr` file to the CA.
2. Completing domain validation steps (if required).
3. Receiving the signed certificate (`.cer`, `.pem`, or `.pfx`) from the CA.
4. Importing the signed certificate into Pode for use.

Example: Importing the signed certificate after receiving it from the CA:

```powershell
$cert = Import-PodeCertificate -Path "C:\Certs\signed-cert.pfx" -CertificatePassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "MyPass" -AsPlainText -Force)
if (-not (Test-PodeCertificate -Certificate $cert -ErrorAction Stop)) {
    throw 'Certificate not valid'
}
```

Alternatively, you can use:

```powershell
Test-PodeCertificate -Certificate $cert -ErrorAction Stop | Out-Null
```

to force an exception if the certificate fails validation.
**Refer to the `Test-PodeCertificate` documentation for any parameter details.**

---

## Exporting a Certificate

Pode allows exporting certificates in various formats such as PFX and PEM. To export a certificate:

```powershell
Export-PodeCertificate -Certificate $cert -FilePath "C:\Certs\mycert" -Format "PFX" -CertificatePassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "MyPass" -AsPlainText -Force)
```

or as a PEM file with a separate private key:

```powershell
Export-PodeCertificate -Certificate $cert -FilePath "C:\Certs\mycert" -Format "PEM" -IncludePrivateKey
```

## Checking a Certificate’s Purpose

A certificate's **purpose** is defined by its **Enhanced Key Usage (EKU)** attributes, which specify what the certificate is allowed to be used for. Common EKU values include:

- `ServerAuth` – Used for server authentication in HTTPS.
- `ClientAuth` – Used for client authentication in mutual TLS setups.
- `CodeSigning` – Used for digitally signing software and scripts.
- `EmailSecurity` – Used for securing email communication.

Pode can extract the EKU of a certificate to determine its intended purposes:

```powershell
$purposes = Get-PodeCertificatePurpose -Certificate $cert
$purposes
```

### Enforcing Certificate Purpose

When Pode validates a certificate, it ensures that the certificate’s EKU matches the expected usage. If a certificate is used for an endpoint but lacks the required EKU (e.g., using a `CodeSigning` certificate for `ServerAuth`), Pode will reject the certificate and fail to bind it to the endpoint.

For example, if an HTTPS endpoint is created, the certificate **must** include `ServerAuth`:

```powershell
$cert = New-PodeSelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "example.com" -CertificatePurpose ServerAuth

Start-PodeServer {
    Add-PodeEndpoint -Address * -Port 8443 -Protocol Https -X509Certificate $cert
}
```

If the certificate lacks the correct EKU, Pode will return an error when attempting to bind it.

## Importing an Existing Certificate

To import a certificate from a file or the Windows certificate store:

```powershell
$cert = Import-PodeCertificate -Path "C:\Certs\mycert.pfx" -CertificatePassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "MyPass" -AsPlainText -Force)
```

If you import a certificate without validating it, you should then call **`Test-PodeCertificate`** to verify that the certificate is valid:

```powershell
if (-not (Test-PodeCertificate -Certificate $cert -ErrorAction Stop)) {
    throw 'Certificate not valid'
}
```

Alternatively, you can force an exception by piping the output:

```powershell
Test-PodeCertificate -Certificate $cert -ErrorAction Stop | Out-Null
```

Refer to the **Test-PodeCertificate** section below for more details on all available parameters.

## Testing a Certificate’s Validity

Pode provides the **`Test-PodeCertificate`** function to validate an **X.509 certificate** and ensure it meets security and usage requirements.

### Features of `Test-PodeCertificate`

- ✅ Checks if the certificate is **within its validity period** (`NotBefore` and `NotAfter`).
- ✅ **Builds the certificate chain** to verify its trust.
- ✅ Supports **online and offline revocation checking** (OCSP/CRL).
- ✅ Allows **optional enforcement of strong cryptographic algorithms**.
- ✅ Provides an option to **reject self-signed certificates**.
- ✅ Optionally checks that the certificate’s Enhanced Key Usage (EKU) matches an **ExpectedPurpose** (with an optional **Strict** mode).

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Certificate Validation

```powershell
Test-PodeCertificate -Certificate $cert
```

- Checks if the certificate is currently valid.
- Does **not** check revocation status.

#### Validate Certificate with Online Revocation Checking

```powershell
Test-PodeCertificate -Certificate $cert -CheckRevocation
```

- Uses **OCSP/CRL lookup** to check if the certificate is revoked.

#### Validate Certificate with Offline (Cached CRL) Revocation Check

```powershell
Test-PodeCertificate -Certificate $cert -CheckRevocation -OfflineRevocation
```

- Uses **only locally cached CRLs**, making it suitable for air-gapped environments.

#### Allow Certificates with Weak Algorithms

```powershell
Test-PodeCertificate -Certificate $cert -AllowWeakAlgorithms
```

- Allows the use of certificates with **SHA1, MD5, or RSA-1024**.

#### Reject Self-Signed Certificates

```powershell
Test-PodeCertificate -Certificate $cert -DenySelfSigned
```

- Fails validation if the certificate **is self-signed**.

#### Enforce Expected Certificate Purpose

```powershell
Test-PodeCertificate -Certificate $cert -ExpectedPurpose CodeSigning -Strict
```

- Validates that the certificate is explicitly authorized for **CodeSigning**.
- In strict mode, if any unknown EKUs are present, the validation fails.

## Using Certificates for JWT Authentication

Pode supports using X.509 certificates for JWT authentication. You can specify a certificate for signing and verifying JWTs by providing `-X509Certificate` when creating a bearer authentication scheme:

```powershell
$cert = Import-PodeCertificate -Path "C:\Certs\jwt-signing-cert.pfx" -CertificatePassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "MyPass" -AsPlainText -Force)

Start-PodeServer {
    New-PodeAuthBearerScheme `
        -AsJWT `
        -X509Certificate $cert |
    Add-PodeAuth -Name 'JWTAuth' -Sessionless -ScriptBlock {
        param($token)

        # Validate and extract user details
        return @{ User = $user }
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you can use a self-signed certificate for development and testing:

```powershell
Start-PodeServer {
    New-PodeAuthBearerScheme `
        -AsJWT `
        -SelfSigned |
    Add-PodeAuth -Name 'JWTAuth' -Sessionless -ScriptBlock {
        param($token)

        # Validate and extract user details
        return @{ User = $user }
    }
}
```

Using certificates for JWT authentication provides enhanced security by enabling asymmetric signing (RSA/ECDSA) rather than using a shared secret.
