# Components

When building limit rules - such as Access or Rate - you build them using various "components". The following inbuilt components currently exist:

* IP
* Route
* Endpoint
* Method
* Header

You can use these components on their own, or combine them to make more advanced limit rule configurations. For example, limit requests from a subnet to a specific group of Routes - say limiting requests to 10 per minute, to the Routes under `/api/*`:

```powershell
Add-PodeLimitRateRule -Name 'example' -Limit 10 -Duration 60000 -Component @(
    New-PodeLimitIPComponent -Value '10.10.0.0/24' -Group
    New-PodeLimitRouteComponent -Value '/api/*' -Group
)
```

## IP

An IP Component can be created via [`New-PodeLimitIPComponent`](../../../../../Functions/Limit/New-PodeLimitIPComponent). You can specify none, one, or more IP or subnet addresses - if none are supplied, then the component will match every IP.

```powershell
# match every IP - and treat them individually
New-PodeLimitIPComponent

# match every IP - but treat them as 1 entity
New-PodeLimitIPComponent -Group

# match specific IP address(es)
New-PodeLimitIPComponent -IP '10.0.0.92', '192.0.1.131'

# match all IPs in a subnet - and treat them individually
New-PodeLimitIPComponent -IP '10.0.1.0/16'

# match all IPs in a subnet - but treat them as 1 entity
New-PodeLimitIPComponent -IP '10.0.1.0/16' -Group
```

By default, Pode will retrieve the IP address for the request from the Remote Address of the connecting socket. If you're using a proxy - such as a WAF, Load Balancer, or even IIS, then you can instead use the IP from the `X-Forwarded-For` header. The default IP used from the header will be the leftmost IP (typically the originating client IP), but you can also use either the rightmost IP (typically the IP of the last proxy), or all IPs.

```powershell
# use the leftmost IP in the X-Forwarded-For header
New-PodeLimitIPComponent -IP '10.0.0.92' -Location 'XForwardedFor'

# use the rightmost IP in the X-Forwarded-For header
New-PodeLimitIPComponent -IP '10.0.0.92' -Location 'XForwardedFor' -XForwardedForType 'Rightmost'

# check all of the IPs in the X-Forwarded-For header
New-PodeLimitIPComponent -IP '10.0.0.92' -Location 'XForwardedFor' -XForwardedForType 'All'
```

!!! note
    When using `-XForwardedForType 'All'`, at least 1 of the IPs must match an IP from the `-IP` parameter.

## Route

A Route Component can be created via [`New-PodeLimitRouteComponent`](../../../../../Functions/Limit/New-PodeLimitRouteComponent). You can specify none, one, or more Route paths - if none are supplied, then the component will match every Route path. You can also use wildcard/regex to match multiple Routes.

```powershell
# match every Route - and treat them individually
New-PodeLimitRouteComponent

# match every Route - but treat them as 1 entity
New-PodeLimitRouteComponent -Group

# match specific Route path(s)
New-PodeLimitRouteComponent -Path '/download', '/api/users'

# match all Routes via a wildcard - and treat them individually
New-PodeLimitRouteComponent -Path '/api/*'

# match all Routes via a wildcard - but treat them as 1 entity
New-PodeLimitRouteComponent -Path '/api/*' -Group
```

## Endpoint

An Endpoint Component can be created via [`New-PodeLimitEndpointComponent`](../../../../../Functions/Limit/New-PodeLimitEndpointComponent). You can specify none, one, or more Endpoint names - if none are supplied, then the component will match every Endpoint.

```powershell
# match every Endpoint - and treat them individually
New-PodeLimitEndpointComponent

# match specific Endpoint(s)
New-PodeLimitEndpointComponent -Name 'api', 'admin'
```

## Method

A Method Component can be created via [`New-PodeLimitMethodComponent`](../../../../../Functions/Limit/New-PodeLimitMethodComponent). You can specify none, one, or more HTTP methods - if none are supplied, then the component will match every method.

```powershell
# match every Method - and treat them individually
New-PodeLimitMethodComponent

# match specific Method(s)
New-PodeLimitMethodComponent -Method 'Get', 'Post'
```

## Header

A Header Component can be created via [`New-PodeLimitHeaderComponent`](../../../../../Functions/Limit/New-PodeLimitHeaderComponent). You can specify one or more Headers, and you can also specify specific values for the Headers to match on as well.

```powershell
# match a specific Header - and treat different values individually
New-PodeLimitHeaderComponent -Name 'X-API-KEY'

# match a specific Header - but ignore the value, and treat them as 1 entity
New-PodeLimitHeaderComponent -Name 'X-API-KEY' -Group

# match a specific Header, with a specific value
New-PodeLimitHeaderComponent -Name 'X-API-KEY' -Value '1c1aad92-194e-433a-bf0a-385434dcac13'
```
