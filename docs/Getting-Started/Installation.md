    * Linux
    * MacOS
    * Raspberry Pi

To install Pode from the PowerShell Gallery, you can use the following:

## Docker

Pode can run on *nix environments, therefore it only makes sense for there to be Docker images for you to use! The images use the latest version of PowerShell v7.5 on either an Ubuntu Noble image (default), an Alpine image, or an ARM32 image (for Raspberry Pis).

* To pull down the latest Pode image you can do:

```powershell
# for latest
docker pull badgerati/pode:latest

# or the following for a specific version:
docker pull badgerati/pode:2.2.2
```

* To pull down the Alpine Pode image you can do:

```powershell
# for latest
docker pull badgerati/pode:latest-alpine

# or the following for a specific version:
docker pull badgerati/pode:2.2.2-alpine
```

* To pull down the ARM32 Pode image you can do:

```powershell
# for latest
docker pull badgerati/pode:latest-arm32

# or the following for a specific version:
docker pull badgerati/pode:2.2.2-arm32
```

Once pulled, you can [view here](../../Hosting/Docker) on how to use the image.

## GitHub Package Registry

You can also get the Pode docker image from the GitHub Package Registry! The images are the same as the ones hosted in Docker.

* To pull down the latest Pode image you can do:

```powershell
# for latest
docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/badgerati/pode/pode:latest

# or the following for a specific version:
docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/badgerati/pode/pode:2.2.2
```

* To pull down the Alpine Pode image you can do:

```powershell
# for latest
docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/badgerati/pode/pode:latest-alpine

# or the following for a specific version:
docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/badgerati/pode/pode:2.2.2-alpine
```

* To pull down the ARM32 Pode image you can do:

```powershell
# for latest
docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/badgerati/pode/pode:latest-arm32

# or the following for a specific version:
docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/badgerati/pode/pode:2.2.2-arm32
```

Once pulled, you can [view here](../../Hosting/Docker) on how to use the image.

## Using the Module

After you have installed the module all functions should be readily available to you. In the case of the Docker images, the module is pre-installed for you.

If you have any issues then you can try and import the module into your server scripts:

```powershell
Import-Module Pode
```
