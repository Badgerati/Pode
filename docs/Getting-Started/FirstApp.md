# Building your first Pode app

!!! important
    Before starting, ensure you've [installed](../Installation) Pode.

The following steps will run you through creating your first Pode app, and give you an overview to some of the basic features.

## Setup

* First, create a `/my-first-pode-app` directory, this should be where ever you put your project/learning code.

* Open PowerShell, and navigate to the above directory.

* Run `pode init` in the console, this will create a basic `package.json` file for you - see the [`CLI`](../CLI) reference for more information.

* The `init` action will ask for some input, leave everything as default (just press enter).

```powershell
PS> pode init
name (my-first-pode-app):
version (1.0.0):
description:
entry point (./server.ps1):
author:
license (MIT):
Success, saved package.json
```

* In your favourite text editor, create a `server.ps1` file within the directory.

## REST Server

* Although not required, it is recommended to import the Pode module using a maximum version, to avoid any breaking changes from new major versions:

```powershell
Import-Module -Name Pode -MaximumVersion 2.99.99
```

* To ensure that any errors during the import process are caught and handled appropriately, use a try-catch block:

```powershell
try {
    Import-Module -Name 'Pode' -MaximumVersion 2.99.99 -ErrorAction Stop
} catch {
    # exception management code
}
```

* Within your `server.ps1` file, first you need to start the Server. This is where the main script will go that defines how the server should function:

```powershell
Start-PodeServer {
    # logic
}
```

* Now we have our server, we need to get it to listen on an endpoint. This will allow us to receive requests and respond to them. The below tells your server to listen on `localhost` and port `8080` for HTTP requests:

```powershell
Start-PodeServer {
    Add-PodeEndpoint -Address localhost -Port 8080 -Protocol Http
}
```

* Our simple server will have a single GET [`route`](../../Tutorials/Routes/Overview); it will be invoked when the root (`/`) of the server is called (ie: `http://localhost:8080/`). This route will respond with a simple JSON response:

```powershell
Start-PodeServer {
    Add-PodeEndpoint -Address localhost -Port 8080 -Protocol Http

    Add-PodeRoute -Method Get -Path '/' -ScriptBlock {
        Write-PodeJsonResponse -Value @{ 'value' = 'Hello, world!' }
    }
}
```

* Save the file, and run `pode start` (or just `./server.ps1`) from the terminal. This will start the server listening on `localhost:8080`. When `http://localhost:8080/` is hit, the server will respond with:

```json
{
    "value": "Hello, world!"
}
```

!!! note
    If you have issues with `pode start`, just invoke `./server.ps1` directly.
